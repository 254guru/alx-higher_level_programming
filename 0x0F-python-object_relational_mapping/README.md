# Python - Object-relational mapping
An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored inrelational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code.

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to map objects from an object-oriented programming language to entities in a relational database management system (RDBMS). ORM frameworks abstract the interaction with the database by representing database tables as classes, rows as objects, and columns as object attributes.

ORM frameworks facilitate the translation between the object-oriented language used in application code (such as Python, Java, or C#) and the relational database, making it easier to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without writing raw SQL queries.

In Python, there are several ORM frameworks available, each with its own features and advantages:<li>
